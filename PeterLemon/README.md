# Tests by PeterLemon

This contains `git subtree` mirrors of various parts of
[the original repository][r].

  - [SNES-CPUTest-CPU](./SNES-CPUTest-CPU/) mirrors
    the `CPUTest/CPU` directory.
  - [SNES-CHIP-GSU-GSUTest](./SNES-CHIP-GSU-GSUTest/) mirrors
    the `CHIP/GSU/GSUTest` directory.

Unless otherwise noted,
tests are built with the `bass` assembler.

Run the corresponding update script to update the mirror to the latest version.

# Motive's hblank emu test

> This demo has two different modes beside each other on the same screen.
> Currently no emulator gets it perfect, the most common issue being that the

> In Mesen-S, the mode on the right does indeed bounce about (It's stationary on

> background behind the mode 3 one on the left.

> In this one I've also used windows to hide the middle section: on hardware

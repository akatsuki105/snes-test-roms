mul
---
WRMPYB write starts multiply if one isn't running.
WRMPYB write clears RDMPY even if multiply is in progress (value written is ignored).
WRMPYA write doesn't affect current multiply.

Start multiply:
	Copy WRMPYA to RDDIVL.
	Copy WRMPYB to RDDIVH.
	Copy WRMPYB to internal left shifter.

Each step of multiply:
	If low bit of RDDIVL is set, add internal shifter to RDMPY.
	Internal shifter left by one bit.


div
---
WRDIVL write during divide has no effect on result.
WRDIVH write during divide has no effect on result.
WRDIVB write during divide reloads RDMPY with last written value to WRDIV (value written is ignored).

Start divide:
	Copy WRDIV to RDMPY.
	Copy WRDIVB to internal right shifter.
